description: Generate the standard Swift Package Manager toolchain for a new Swift library at the repository root — runs `swift package init --type library`, then rewrites `Package.swift` (`// swift-tools-version: 6.0`, a `platforms:` array, a `swift-docc-plugin` dependency, `swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`), `Sources/<Name>/<Name>.swift`, and `Tests/<Name>Tests/` with both a Swift Testing `@Test` example and an XCTest example, plus `.swiftlint.yml` (opt-in strict rules, `excluded: .build`), a `.swift-format` (or `.swiftformat`) config, a DocC catalog page (`Sources/<Name>/<Name>.docc/<Name>.md`), `.spi.yml` (only when `publish: yes`), and `sonar-project.properties` (only when `sonar` is not `none`) — asks for `package-name` (the SPM package identity, e.g. `my-example-lib`; the PascalCase `<Name>` used for the target/product/type/directories is derived from it), `platforms` (a list from `ios`/`ipados`/`macos`/`watchos`/`tvos`/`visionos`/`linux`), `min-deployment-targets` per selected Apple platform, license, developer name/email/organization URL, whether the project is open source, whether it publishes (`publish`, gating `.spi.yml`), whether to wire up a SonarQube/SonarCloud scan (`sonar`: `cloud`/`self-hosted`/`none`, gating `sonar-project.properties`), and `formatter` (`swift-format`, the Swift toolchain's own bundled formatter, invoked as `swift format lint`/`swift format format` — or `swiftformat`, the third-party nicklockwood/SwiftFormat tool, with a different config-file convention). Invoke as `/iru-setup-swift-library`. Ships with explicit example templates embedded in this skill file, verified end-to-end against Swift 6.4/Xcode 27 (`swift build`, `swift test --enable-code-coverage`, `xcrun llvm-cov export -format=lcov`, `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources`, and `swift package generate-documentation` all run clean against them — see this file's "Known quirks / verification notes"). Every dependency version (`swift-docc-plugin`) is looked up at run time from the GitHub Releases API, with this skill's own September 2026 findings as the fallback. If any of this skill's files already exist, asks whether to stop, fill gaps only, or regenerate (`mode: existing` skips straight to gap-fill, this catalog's shared front-door convention); accepts every input pre-resolved via `args` (`key: value` lines) so an orchestrating skill (e.g. a future `iru-setup-swift-repository`) can supply them without re-prompting. Verifies with `swift build` then `swift test` through the `iru-gate-runner` agent. Equivalent to `iru-setup-java-library`/`iru-setup-typescript-library`/`iru-setup-android-library` for the Swift/SwiftPM stack. Use whenever a new Swift library repository needs its `Package.swift`/source layout/lint/format/docs toolchain scaffolded from this house template, instead of hand-writing each file.

# Setup Swift Library

Generate the standard Swift Package Manager library toolchain at the repository root: `Package.swift`, the
`Sources/<Name>/` and `Tests/<Name>Tests/` layout, `.swiftlint.yml`, a `.swift-format`/`.swiftformat` config, a
DocC catalog page, and — when opted in — `.spi.yml` and `sonar-project.properties`. Every file starts from
`swift package init --type library`'s own scaffold (Step 5), then this skill rewrites it using explicit example
templates embedded below (Steps 5–9), genericized (no real repo/org/person names, `<placeholder>` markers resolved
from Steps 2–4) and verified end-to-end against Swift 6.4/Xcode 27 in `$TMPDIR/iru-verify/swift/library` while
building this skill.

**`swiftLanguageModes:` requires `// swift-tools-version: 6.0` or newer** — it does not exist as a `Package`
initializer parameter under older tools-versions (SwiftPM parses the manifest with a compiler pinned to the
declared tools-version, so an older declaration fails to even parse a manifest that uses it). This skill always
writes `// swift-tools-version: 6.0` for exactly this reason, even though `swift package init` itself defaults to
whatever tools-version the active toolchain ships (`6.4` was observed here, Step 10's quirks).

## Step 0 — Resolve inputs

This skill can be invoked stand-alone (`/iru-setup-swift-library`) or as a step inside another skill (e.g. a
future `iru-setup-swift-repository` or the catalog's `iru-setup-repository` front door), which resolves these same
inputs itself and passes them through `args` as `key: value` lines, one per line, e.g.:

```
package-name: my-example-lib
platforms: ios, macos
min-deployment-targets: ios=17.0, macos=14.0
license: Apache License 2.0
developer-name: Jane Doe
developer-email: jane@example.com
organization-url: https://github.com/example-org
open-source: yes
publish: yes
sonar: cloud
sonar-organization: example-org-github
sonar-project-key: example-org_my-example-lib
sonar-host-url: https://sonarcloud.io
formatter: swift-format
mode: new
```

Parse any such lines from `args` now. Every field found here is resolved — skip asking about it in Step 2. Only
fields genuinely missing from `args` still need a question. If `args` is absent or doesn't look like this format,
treat everything as unset and ask normally.

Recognized keys: `package-name` (the SwiftPM package identity written to `Package(name: ...)` — may contain
hyphens, e.g. `my-example-lib`; see Step 2 for how the PascalCase `<Name>` used everywhere else is derived from
it), `platforms` (a comma/space-separated list from `ios`/`ipados`/`macos`/`watchos`/`tvos`/`visionos`/`linux`),
`min-deployment-targets` (only relevant for whichever of `ios`/`ipados`/`macos`/`watchos`/`tvos`/`visionos` was
selected — `linux` has no deployment-target concept in SwiftPM, see Step 2), `license`, `developer-name`,
`developer-email`, `organization-url`, `open-source` (`yes`/`no`), `publish` (`yes`/`no`), `sonar`
(`cloud`/`self-hosted`/`none`) plus, only when `sonar` is `cloud` or `self-hosted`,
`sonar-organization`/`sonar-project-key`/`sonar-host-url`, `formatter` (`swift-format`/`swiftformat`, default
`swift-format`), and `mode` (`new`/`existing`).

`mode: existing` is this catalog's shared signal (set by a front door that already ran `iru-explore` and knows
this is an established repository) that Step 1 should skip its stop-or-regenerate question entirely and go
straight to gap-fill: create only whatever files from Steps 5–9 are genuinely missing, and leave every file that
already exists untouched. `mode: new` or an unset `mode` follows Step 1's normal survey instead.

## Step 1 — Survey the repository

Check, at the repository root, which of this skill's files already exist: `Package.swift`, `Sources/*/*.swift`,
`Tests/*Tests/*.swift` (a `Package.swift` alone, with no matching `Sources/<Name>/` tree, still counts as
"exists" — treat it the same as any other partial state), `.swiftlint.yml`, `.swift-format` or `.swiftformat`
(whichever `formatter` — once resolved — points at), `Sources/*/*.docc/*.md`, `.spi.yml` (only relevant once
`publish` is resolved in Step 2), `sonar-project.properties` (only relevant once `sonar` is resolved in Step 2).

- **None exist**: skip straight to Step 2. There is nothing to preserve.
- **`mode: existing` was resolved in Step 0**: skip the question below — go straight to **gap-fill**: create only
  the files that are missing; leave every file that already exists completely untouched (including
  `Package.swift` — merge nothing into it). Note in the final report which files were left alone because they
  already existed.
- **Otherwise, and at least one file already exists**: warn the user which files were found, then use
  `AskUserQuestion` with three options:
  - **Stop** — leave every existing file untouched; make no changes at all. Report this and end here.
  - **Fill gaps only** (recommended once real library code exists under `Sources/<Name>`) — create only the files
    that are missing; don't overwrite anything already present. Same effective behavior as `mode: existing`.
  - **Regenerate everything** — before asking Step 2's questions, read the existing `Package.swift` (if present)
    for its current package name, target name, `platforms:` entries, and whether a `swift-docc-plugin` dependency
    is already present, and use those as the *defaults* offered for whichever Step 2 question Step 0 didn't
    already resolve via `args` — a value supplied via `args` always wins. Tell the user up front that regenerating
    replaces every one of this skill's files wholesale; any customization added since the last run (extra
    targets, extra dependencies, hand-edited source) will be lost unless re-added afterward (call this out again
    in the final report).

## Step 2 — Collect the required inputs

For any field Step 0 already resolved from `args`, use that value directly and don't ask about it again. For
everything else, ask the user directly (plain conversation, pre-filling defaults found in Step 1 if regenerating):

- **package-name** — the SwiftPM package identity, e.g. `my-example-lib`. This is exactly what `Package(name:
  ...)` and a consumer's `.package(url: "<repository-url>", from: "1.0.0")` line use to identify the package; it
  commonly matches the repository name and may contain hyphens.
- **`<Name>`** — derived automatically from `package-name`, never asked separately: PascalCase, each
  `-`/`_`-separated word capitalized and concatenated, non-alphanumeric characters stripped (e.g. `my-example-lib`
  → `MyExampleLib`). `<Name>` is the product/target/type name and the `Sources/<Name>/`, `Tests/<Name>Tests/`,
  `Sources/<Name>/<Name>.docc/` directory names — **never** pass the raw hyphenated `package-name` to `swift
  package init --name` directly; see Step 5's quirk on why that produces snake_case directories instead of the
  clean `<Name>` this skill's templates assume.
- **platforms** — one or more of `ios`, `ipados`, `macos`, `watchos`, `tvos`, `visionos`, `linux` (multi-select;
  offer `AskUserQuestion` with these as options when asking interactively, since bounded and short). Maps to
  `Package.swift`'s `platforms:` array (Step 5) with one caveat each:
  - **`ios` and `ipados` collapse to the same single `.iOS(...)` entry** — SwiftPM's `SupportedPlatform` enum has
    no separate iPadOS case; a package's minimum iOS deployment target already covers both idioms (the
    iPhone/iPad distinction is an app-level `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` concern, not a package-level one). If both
    are selected, ask only once for the shared minimum version in `min-deployment-targets` below and emit a single
    `.iOS(...)` line.
  - **`linux` adds no entry to `platforms:` at all** — confirmed while verifying this skill: `SupportedPlatform`
    has no `.linux` case, and adding one fails the manifest with `error: type
    'Array<SupportedPlatform>.ArrayLiteralElement' (aka 'SupportedPlatform') has no member 'linux'`. Linux (and
    any other non-Apple platform SwiftPM supports) is available automatically whenever the package's code doesn't
    depend on an Apple-only API — there is nothing to add to the manifest to opt in, and nothing to remove to opt
    out short of actually avoiding Apple-only imports. If `linux` is the *only* platform selected, omit the
    `platforms:` key from `Package.swift` entirely rather than writing an empty array.
  - `macos`, `watchos`, `tvos`, `visionos` each map to their own `.macOS(...)`/`.watchOS(...)`/`.tvOS(...)`/
    `.visionOS(...)` entry.
- **min-deployment-targets** — for each selected Apple platform (`ios`/`ipados` counted once, `macos`, `watchos`,
  `tvos`, `visionos`), the minimum OS version, e.g. `ios: 17.0`, `macos: 14.0`. No sensible universal default —
  ask directly; offer the current stable major-minus-one release per platform as a starting suggestion if the
  user has no preference (this skill's own verification run used iOS 17 / macOS 14).
- **Developer name**, **developer email**, **organizationUrl** — used in generated doc-comment headers (Steps 6)
  and, when `publish: yes`, nowhere else — SwiftPM packages have no POM/`package.json`-style `<developers>`/
  `author` metadata block; a package's authorship is conveyed through its git history, README, and `LICENSE`
  file instead.

Then, unless Step 0 already resolved a `license` value from `args`, ask about the **license** with
`AskUserQuestion` (small bounded choice, same four options this catalog's other setup skills use):

- Apache License 2.0 (recommended) — `Apache License 2.0` / `http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt`
- MIT License — `The MIT License` / `https://opensource.org/license/mit`
- No license (proprietary / all rights reserved) — omit the license-header comment from every generated Swift
  file (Steps 6) and from `.swiftlint.yml`'s `file_header` rule (Step 7)
- Other — ask for the license's display name and URL directly afterward

If a license is chosen (anything but "No license"), remind the user in the final report to also add a matching
`LICENSE` file at the repository root if one doesn't exist yet — the `iru-check-license` skill can verify/backfill
file headers against it once it's there.

Then resolve `open-source`, `publish`, and `sonar` — skip any of the three Step 0 already resolved from `args`.
When invoked stand-alone with none of them pre-resolved, ask `open-source` *first* (`AskUserQuestion`: yes/no) and
derive the recommended defaults for the other two from that answer, per this catalog's shared convention:

- **open-source** — is this repository open source? Yes / No.
- **publish** — does this library get distributed for other projects to depend on (via a git URL/tag, and
  optionally listed on the Swift Package Index)? Default **Yes** when open-source is Yes; when not open source,
  ask with **No** recommended, explaining that the Swift Package Index (which `.spi.yml`, Step 8, configures for)
  is a public catalog meant for redistributable open-source packages. `No` omits `.spi.yml` from Step 8's template
  entirely — there is no Maven Central/npm-registry-style publish step for SwiftPM to gate either way; a
  package "publishes" simply by existing at a git URL a consumer can add a `.package(url: ..., from: ...)`
  dependency on, tagged with semver tags, which this skill doesn't need to configure.
- **sonar** — whether to wire up a SonarQube/SonarCloud scan (`sonar-project.properties`, Step 9 — typically
  consumed by a CI workflow such as a future `iru-setup-swift-github-workflows`, so it's worth setting up here
  even if that workflow comes later). Recommend **SonarCloud** (`cloud`) when open-source is Yes; when not open
  source, state that SonarCloud is free only for open-source projects (a paid plan is required otherwise) and
  recommend **None** (`none`), offering **self-hosted SonarQube** as the second option:
  - `cloud` — ask for the `sonar.organization` key, offering `<owner>-github` (the owner parsed in Step 3) as the
    suggested default. Default `sonar.projectKey` to `<owner>_<repo>` and `sonar.host.url` to
    `https://sonarcloud.io`, confirming both with the user rather than assuming silently.
  - `self-hosted` — ask for `sonar.host.url` directly (no sensible default — this is what replaces the fixed
    `https://sonarcloud.io` host in Step 9's template), plus `sonar.organization` only if that server has
    organizations enabled, and `sonar.projectKey`.
  - `none` — omit `sonar-project.properties` entirely (Step 9).

Finally, resolve **formatter** (`swift-format`/`swiftformat`, default `swift-format`) — skip if Step 0 already
resolved it:

- **`swift-format`** (default, recommended) — the Swift toolchain's own bundled formatter (invoked as `swift
  format lint`/`swift format format`, a subcommand of the `swift` driver — not a separate binary to install).
  Configured via a `.swift-format` JSON file (Step 7). This is the only variant this skill actually verified
  end-to-end (Step 10).
- **`swiftformat`** — the third-party nicklockwood/SwiftFormat tool (a different project from Apple's
  `swift-format` despite the near-identical name), configured via a `.swiftformat` file (Step 7) and installed
  separately (typically `brew install swiftformat`, or the Mint/SPM-plugin routes its own README documents) for
  whoever — locally or in CI — needs to invoke it. **Unverified locally** — this environment has no `brew`, and
  building it from source was out of scope for verifying this skill. Say so explicitly if the user picks it.

## Step 3 — Infer repository information

Don't ask for these — derive them from the current repository, the same way `iru-setup-java-library` and
`iru-setup-android-library` do:

- **Owner/repo and host**: parse `git remote get-url origin` (handles both `git@host:owner/repo.git` and
  `https://host/owner/repo.git` forms). Use the parsed owner for the `sonar.organization`/`sonar.projectKey`
  defaults in Step 2 (only relevant when `sonar` isn't `none`), and the parsed host/owner/repo to build
  `<repository-url>` (`https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>`), used only in generated doc-comment headers/README-style
  guidance in the final report — `Package.swift` itself carries no repository URL field. If there's no `origin`
  remote yet, ask the user for the intended repository URL instead of leaving it blank.
- **Inception year**: `git log --reverse --format=%ad --date=format:%Y | head -1` for the first commit's year;
  fall back to the current year if the repository has no commits yet. Feeds the copyright year in Steps 6's
  doc-comment headers (use the *current* year there instead, per that step's own note — a license header's
  copyright year is the year of the file, not the repository's inception year).
- **Stable branch**: default `main` unless the caller (an orchestrator, or the user) names a different stable
  branch — only used, if at all, in the final report's guidance text.

## Step 4 — Look up dependency versions

Look up the version below at run time; only fall back to the table's recorded value if the lookup fails (offline,
GitHub API rate-limited). Note in the final report whenever a fallback was used instead of a live lookup.

| Component | Lookup | September 2026 fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `swift-docc-plugin` (only `publish` question resolved — actually needed regardless of `publish`, since DocC generation is verified unconditionally in Step 12; see Step 8's note) | `gh api repos/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin/releases/latest -q .tag_name` (or `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin/releases/latest`), stripped of a leading `v` if present | `1.5.0` |

Only one dependency is looked up here — unlike the Java/TypeScript/Android siblings, this skill's own toolchain
(`swiftlint`, `swift format`, `swiftformat`) is either bundled with the Swift toolchain (no version to pin — see
Step 7's note) or a standalone CLI installed outside SwiftPM's dependency graph entirely (`swiftlint`,
`swiftformat` — neither is a `Package.swift` dependency; their versions are a CI/local-install concern, not a
manifest concern, and are out of this skill's scope).

## Step 5 — Scaffold via `swift package init`, then rewrite `Package.swift`

Run, at the repository root:

```
swift package init --type library --name <Name>
```

**Always pass the PascalCase `<Name>` here, never the raw hyphenated `package-name`.** Confirmed while verifying
this skill (Swift 6.4/Xcode 27): `swift package init --type library --name my-example-lib` creates
`Sources/my_example_lib/my_example_lib.swift` and `Tests/my_example_libTests/` — SwiftPM silently converts a
hyphenated `--name` into `snake_case` for the target/directory/file names (while keeping the hyphenated form
verbatim as the package's own `Package(name: ...)` identity) rather than PascalCasing it. Passing the already-
PascalCase `<Name>` (e.g. `MyExampleLib`) avoids this entirely — `Sources/MyExampleLib/MyExampleLib.swift`,
`Tests/MyExampleLibTests/MyExampleLibTests.swift`, and every generated name in `Package.swift` come out already
matching what Steps 6–9's templates below expect. This command also emits a `.gitignore` and a `Package.swift`;
both are overwritten by the templates immediately below rather than kept as-is — the `iru-setup-swift-gitignore`
skill (Task 35 of this catalog) is the one responsible for the repository's actual `.gitignore` (see its own
`.build`/`DerivedData`/`xcuserdata` entries, a superset of what `swift package init`'s own default already
covers).

Then rewrite `Package.swift` in full with this template — genericized, verified end-to-end while building this
skill (`swift build` succeeds, including resolving `swift-docc-plugin` over the network — see Step 10):

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "<package-name>",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v<ios-min-major>),
        .macOS(.v<macos-min-major>),
    ],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "<Name>",
            targets: ["<Name>"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin", from: "<swift-docc-plugin-version>"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "<Name>"
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "<Name>Tests",
            dependencies: ["<Name>"]
        ),
    ],
    swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]
)
```

**Argument order inside `Package(...)` is not free-form — the compiler enforces a fixed declaration order and
rejects a manifest that violates it**, confirmed while verifying this skill: placing `dependencies:` after
`swiftLanguageModes:` fails with `error: argument 'dependencies' must precede argument 'swiftLanguageModes'`. The
order shown above (`name`, `platforms`, `products`, `dependencies`, `targets`, `swiftLanguageModes`) is the one
that built clean; keep this exact ordering when adding any further parameter this skill doesn't already write
(e.g. `defaultLocalization`, `cLanguageStandard`) — check the `PackageDescription` module's own declaration order
for where a new parameter belongs rather than appending it wherever seems natural.

- `<package-name>` — Step 2.
- `<Name>` — derived from `<package-name>` per Step 2; used for the product, both targets, and (Steps 6–8) the
  `Sources/<Name>/`, `Tests/<Name>Tests/`, and `Sources/<Name>/<Name>.docc/` directories.
- `platforms:` — built from Step 2's `platforms`/`min-deployment-targets` answers per that step's mapping rules:
  one `.iOS(.v<N>)` entry when `ios` and/or `ipados` was selected, `.macOS(.v<N>)` when `macos` was selected,
  `.watchOS(.v<N>)` when `watchos` was selected, `.tvOS(.v<N>)` when `tvos` was selected, `.visionOS(.v<N>)` when
  `visionos` was selected — omit any entry for a platform not selected, and omit the whole `platforms:` key if
  `linux` was the only platform chosen (SwiftPM has no `SupportedPlatform` case for it; see Step 2). `.v<N>` uses
  SwiftPM's named minor-version case when one exists for the resolved minimum (e.g. `.v17` for iOS 17.0); for a
  minor point release with no named case, use `.v17_1`-style dotted-underscore syntax per `PackageDescription`'s
  own convention, or the numeric form `.custom("17.1", andUpper: "17.1")` only if neither named case applies.
- `dependencies:`/`swift-docc-plugin` — Step 4's resolved version. **Fetching this dependency needs network
  access** — confirmed while verifying this skill: `swift build`'s first run resolves and clones both
  `swift-docc-plugin` and its own transitive `swift-docc-symbolkit` dependency straight from GitHub
  (`Fetching https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin` / `swift-docc-symbolkit`) before compiling anything;
  an offline first run fails outright unless both are already cached under `~/.swiftpm`/`~/Library/Caches/`. This
  is the same class of "first invocation needs the network" caveat `iru-setup-android-library` documents for
  Gradle's own plugin resolution — warn the user of it in the final report the same way.
- `swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]` — always written; this is what this skill's frontmatter note at the top of this file
  refers to as requiring tools-version 6.0+.

## Step 6 — Reference templates: `Sources/<Name>/` and `Tests/<Name>Tests/`

Every generated Swift source/test file below carries this license-header doc comment (omit it entirely, on all
four files, if "No license" was chosen in Step 2):

```swift
//
// Copyright (C) <copyright-year> <developer-name>
//
// Licensed under the <license-name> (the "License");
// you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
// You may obtain a copy of the License at
//
//         <license-url>
//
// Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
// distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
// WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
// See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
// limitations under the License.
//
```

`<copyright-year>` is the *current* year (not Step 3's repository inception year — that's a different field, used
nowhere in this skill's own templates).

### `Sources/<Name>/<Name>.swift`

```swift
// The Swift Programming Language
// https://docs.swift.org/swift-book

/// Placeholder type for the `<package-name>` library.
///
/// Replace this with the library's real first public type — it exists so the generated
/// build/test/lint/coverage/docs pipeline has something concrete to succeed against
/// immediately after scaffolding.
public struct <Name>Example: Sendable {
    /// Creates a new example value.
    public init() {}

    /// Adds two integers together.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - a: The first addend.
    ///   - b: The second addend.
    /// - Returns: The sum of `a` and `b`.
    public func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
        a + b
    }
}
```

Named `<Name>Example` rather than the bare `Example` used by this catalog's Java/Android siblings' own placeholder
type, to avoid colliding with `XCTestCase`/Swift Testing's own vocabulary and with a consumer's likely `Example`
type; `<Name>` is already unique per package. `Sendable` conformance is deliberate, not incidental — under Swift 6
language mode (`swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`, Step 5) with strict concurrency checking on by default, a public type
with no explicit `Sendable`/`~Sendable` annotation still compiles, but this skill states the conformance
explicitly so the scaffold models the concurrency-safety convention `iru-swift-code-one-task`'s own reference
guidance expects from real library code, rather than leaving it implicit on a type the user is meant to replace
anyway.

### `Tests/<Name>Tests/<Name>Tests.swift` — Swift Testing

```swift
import Testing
@testable import <Name>

@Test func addReturnsTheSumOfTwoIntegers() async throws {
    #expect(<Name>Example().add(2, 2) == 4)
}
```

### `Tests/<Name>Tests/<Name>XCTests.swift` — XCTest

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import <Name>

final class <Name>XCTests: XCTestCase {
    func testAddReturnsTheSumOfTwoIntegers() {
        XCTAssertEqual(<Name>Example().add(2, 2), 4)
    }
}
```

Both files live in the **same** `<Name>Tests` test target — confirmed while verifying this skill that `swift test`
runs both frameworks together in one invocation with no extra configuration (`swift test --enable-code-coverage`'s
console output shows an XCTest `Test Suite` block and a separate Swift Testing `◇ Test run started` block, both
passing, from the single command). There is no need for two separate test targets just to mix the two frameworks;
`iru-swift-test`'s own `swift test --filter` selector matches tests from either framework interchangeably.
`swift package init --type library` on this skill's own verified toolchain (Swift 6.4/Xcode 27) generates
**only** the Swift Testing file by default — no XCTest example — confirmed in Step 10's quirks; this skill adds
the XCTest file itself so a consumer sees both idioms represented, per the task this skill was built from.

## Step 7 — Reference templates: `.swiftlint.yml` and the formatter config

### `.swiftlint.yml`

```yaml
opt_in_rules:
  - array_init
  - closure_end_indentation
  - closure_spacing
  - collection_alignment
  - contains_over_filter_count
  - contains_over_filter_is_empty
  - contains_over_first_not_nil
  - discouraged_optional_boolean

**Unverified locally** (this environment has no `brew`, and no prebuilt `swiftlint` binary could be installed to
confirm this config actually parses and every listed `opt_in_rules` id is still valid under the current SwiftLint
release — SwiftLint periodically renames or retires rule ids across major versions). Cross-check every rule id
against the SwiftLint release notes/`swiftlint rules` output before relying on this file as-is; the
`iru-swift-code-quality` skill already treats a missing `swiftlint` binary as "not wired" rather than silently
skipping the check, so a rule-id typo here will surface the first time that skill actually runs SwiftLint against
a repository with it installed. `excluded: .build` is required regardless — SwiftLint otherwise walks the entire
build cache (including fetched `swift-docc-plugin`/`swift-docc-symbolkit` checkouts under `.build/checkouts`) and
lints third-party source it doesn't own.

**Verified working end-to-end** against Swift 6.4/Xcode 27 (Step 10): `swift format dump-configuration` prints
the toolchain's own default ruleset (all keys above are real, current rule ids taken straight from that output —
this file only flips several from the default `false` to `true`, opting into a stricter bar than the toolchain's
own out-of-the-box config, the same "opt-in strict rules" posture `.swiftlint.yml` above takes); `swift format
lint --strict --recursive Sources` genuinely picks up `.swift-format` with **no `--configuration` flag needed**
(SwiftPM discovers a `.swift-format` file at the package root automatically) and genuinely enforces it — confirmed
by a deliberate violation (an undocumented public `init()`) failing with `error:
[AllPublicDeclarationsHaveDocumentation] add a documentation comment for 'init'`, then passing clean once
documented. `swift format --version` itself unhelpfully reports `main` (not a semver) on this toolchain — `swift
format` is bundled with the Swift toolchain, not installed as its own versioned dependency, so there is no
separate version for this skill to look up or pin (unlike `swiftlint`/`swiftformat` below).

### `.swiftformat` (when `formatter: swiftformat` — **unverified locally**, see Step 2)

```
--swiftversion 6.0
--indent 4
--maxwidth 120
--self remove
--trailingcommas always
--wraparguments before-first
--wrapparameters before-first
```

This is the third-party nicklockwood/SwiftFormat tool's own line-based config format (distinct from Apple's
`swift-format` JSON above, despite the similar name) — every flag here is `swiftformat`'s documented CLI option
spelled without its leading `--`. Not run against a real `swiftformat` binary while building this skill (no
`brew`, Step 2's caveat) — treat the flag names/values as a starting point, not a confirmed-working config, and
re-verify once `swiftformat` is actually installable in the environment this scaffold targets.

## Step 8 — Reference template: `.spi.yml` (only when `publish: yes`)

```yaml
version: 1
builder:
  configs:
    - documentation_targets: [<Name>]
```

This is the Swift Package Index's own build-configuration file (https://swiftpackageindex.com) — it tells the
index which target(s) to build DocC documentation for when the package is submitted there. It has no bearing on
`swift build`/`swift test` locally or in CI; omit the file entirely when `publish: no` (Step 2), since a
closed-source package is never submitted to the public index. Confirmed the DocC generation this file's
`documentation_targets` key implies (`swift package generate-documentation --target <Name>
--transform-for-static-hosting`) succeeds locally against this skill's own scaffold regardless of the `publish`
answer — see Step 10's quirks for the exact command and its default output location.

## Step 9 — Reference template: `sonar-project.properties` (only when `sonar` is not `none`)

```properties
sonar.projectKey=<sonar-project-key>
sonar.organization=<sonar-organization>
sonar.host.url=<sonar-host-url>

sonar.sources=Sources
sonar.tests=Tests
sonar.swift.file.suffixes=.swift

sonar.coverageReportPaths=sonarqube-generic-coverage.xml
sonar.swiftlint.reportPaths=swiftlint.json
```

- `sonar.organization` is only meaningful for `sonar: cloud` (SonarCloud) — omit that line entirely for `sonar:
  self-hosted` unless the user's self-hosted server also has organizations enabled (Step 2).
- `sonar.coverageReportPaths` points at a SonarQube Generic Coverage Format XML file — **this skill does not
  generate that file itself**; it is produced by converting `xcrun llvm-cov export` output (Step 10's coverage
  quirk) via `slather coverage --sonarqube-xml` or SonarSource's own `xccov-to-sonarqube-generic.sh` script,
  typically as a CI step (a future `iru-setup-swift-github-workflows`, Task 36 of this catalog's plan). Note this
  explicitly in the final report so the user doesn't expect `sonar-project.properties` alone to make a local
  `sonar-scanner` run report coverage.
- `sonar.swiftlint.reportPaths` similarly expects a `swiftlint lint --reporter json > swiftlint.json` run to have
  already produced that file — also a CI/manual step this skill doesn't run itself.
- No `sonar.sourceEncoding` line is needed the way the Java/Android templates carry one — SwiftPM/Xcode source is
  UTF-8 only; there's no encoding ambiguity for the scanner to resolve.

## Step 10 — `Package.resolved` policy note

This skill's own verification run (Step 12) generates a `Package.resolved` file the moment `swift build`/`swift
test` first resolves the `swift-docc-plugin` dependency (Step 5) — but this skill does **not** decide whether that
file gets committed. That decision, and the actual `.gitignore` entry either way, belongs to the
`iru-setup-swift-gitignore` skill's own `package-resolved: commit|ignore` input (Task 35 of this catalog's plan):
that skill's recommended default is **ignore** for a library (`flavor: library`) — a library's own
`Package.resolved` only pins versions for its own development/test builds, never for a downstream consumer
(SwiftPM always re-resolves against the *consumer's* manifest, ignoring the library's own lockfile) — versus
**commit** for an app, where pinning the exact resolved graph matters for reproducible builds. Mention this
explicitly in the final report and point at `iru-setup-swift-gitignore` rather than writing a root `.gitignore`
entry for it here — this skill, like its Java/TypeScript/Android siblings, never touches the repository's
`.gitignore` itself.

No `.github/CODEOWNERS` file is written by this skill — code ownership is a repository/organization policy
decision outside a library-scaffolding skill's scope, and this catalog has no shared convention pushing one from
here (unlike, say, a shared `sonar-project.properties`/`.spi.yml` template, which every consumer of this house
pattern is expected to want).

## Step 11 — Resolve every placeholder

One consolidated resolution table for every `<placeholder>` used across Steps 5–9 — cross-reference this when
filling any template above:

| Placeholder | Source |
|---|---|
| `<package-name>` | Step 2 |
| `<Name>` | Derived from `<package-name>` per Step 2's PascalCase rule |
| `<ios-min-major>`, `<macos-min-major>` (and the equivalent for any other selected Apple platform) | Step 2's `min-deployment-targets`; omitted per-platform if that platform wasn't selected, and the whole `platforms:` key omitted if only `linux` was selected |
| `<swift-docc-plugin-version>` | Step 4 |
| `<copyright-year>` | The current year |
| `<developer-name>`, `<license-name>`, `<license-url>` | Step 2; if "No license", drop the entire header comment block instead of leaving empty lines |
| `<sonar-project-key>`, `<sonar-organization>`, `<sonar-host-url>` | Step 2's `sonar` answer; omit `sonar-project.properties` entirely if `sonar: none`, and omit just the `sonar.organization` line for `sonar: self-hosted` without organizations enabled |

`publish: no` omits `.spi.yml` (Step 8) entirely, with no placeholders of its own beyond `<Name>`.

## Step 12 — Write the files

Apply Step 1's decision (regenerate / fill gaps only / gap-fill from `mode: existing`) file by file, across every
file listed in Steps 5–9 — write each one unless "fill gaps only"/`mode: existing` found that specific file
already present, in which case leave it untouched. Create every intermediate directory (`Sources/<Name>/`,
`Sources/<Name>/<Name>.docc/`, `Tests/<Name>Tests/`) as needed — don't touch any other file already inside a
directory this skill writes into.

## Step 13 — Verify

Run through the `iru-gate-runner` agent (per this catalog's convention: gates run through it rather than inline
Bash, so the caller gets a compact pass/fail summary instead of raw `swift build`/`swift test` output):

1. `swift build` — compiles the package, including resolving `swift-docc-plugin` over the network on a first run
   (Step 5's note). **Note explicitly to the user**: this first invocation can take noticeably longer than a
   subsequent one purely from that dependency fetch, independent of the package's own compile time.
2. `swift test` — runs both the Swift Testing and XCTest examples from Step 6 in one invocation; treat a
   non-zero exit, or console output reporting fewer than 2 total tests, as a failure worth reporting (the
   `iru-swift-test` skill's own "0 tests matched" convention — a selector or misconfigured target silently
   running nothing is a failure mode, not a clean pass).

If either step fails, report the actual `swift build`/`swift test` error to the user rather than guessing at a
fix — a network-blocked `swift-docc-plugin` fetch, a platform/deployment-target mismatch, or a missing Xcode
Command Line Tools installation are all common first-run causes and are not, by themselves, defects in this
skill's templates.

### Known quirks / verification notes (from building and verifying this skill against Swift 6.4/Xcode 27, September 2026)

- **`swift package init --type library --name <name>` does not PascalCase a hyphenated name** — passing
  `my-example-lib` directly produces `Sources/my_example_lib/my_example_lib.swift` and
  `Tests/my_example_libTests/`, converting hyphens to underscores for the target/directory/file names while
  keeping the hyphenated form verbatim as `Package(name: "my-example-lib")`. Passing the already-PascalCase
  `<Name>` (`MyExampleLib`) instead avoids this — confirmed clean `Sources/MyExampleLib/`,
  `Tests/MyExampleLibTests/` output. Step 5 above always uses `<Name>` for exactly this reason.
- **`swift package init --type library` generates only a Swift Testing example, no XCTest example**, on this
  toolchain (Swift 6.4/Xcode 27) — the default `Tests/<Name>Tests/<Name>Tests.swift` uses `import Testing` /
  `@Test func example() async throws {}` exclusively. This skill's Step 6 adds the XCTest file itself; don't
  assume a future toolchain's own default scaffold will keep matching this exactly.
- **Default tools-version is whatever the active toolchain reports, not a fixed value** — this environment's
  `swift package init` wrote `// swift-tools-version: 6.4` (matching `swift --version`'s `Apple Swift version
  6.4`), not `6.0` or any other fixed number. This skill always overwrites it to exactly `// swift-tools-version:
  6.0` (Step 5) — the minimum that supports `swiftLanguageModes:` — rather than keeping whatever the local
  toolchain happened to default to, so a package built with this skill on a newer toolchain doesn't silently
  require a newer minimum Swift than intended.
- **`Package(...)`'s parameter order is enforced by the compiler, not just a style convention** — confirmed
  `dependencies:` placed after `swiftLanguageModes:` fails to parse with `error: argument 'dependencies' must
  precede argument 'swiftLanguageModes'`. The order in Step 5's template (`name`, `platforms`, `products`,
  `dependencies`, `targets`, `swiftLanguageModes`) is the one verified to build clean.
- **`.linux` is not a valid `SupportedPlatform` case** — confirmed `platforms: [.linux]` fails with `error: type
  'Array<SupportedPlatform>.ArrayLiteralElement' (aka 'SupportedPlatform') has no member 'linux'`. Linux support
  is implicit (no manifest entry needed or possible) — Step 2/Step 5 both document this.
- **`swift-docc-plugin` resolution needs network access on a first run** — confirmed `swift build` fetches both
  `swift-docc-plugin` and its transitive `swift-docc-symbolkit` dependency straight from GitHub before compiling;
  there is no vendored/offline fallback baked into this skill's template.
- **The new Swift Build system (this toolchain's default) reshapes `.build/` layout** — confirmed `.build/debug`
  is a **symlink** to `.build/out/Products/Debug/`, not a real directory as on older toolchains/Linux (which use
  `.build/debug/` directly, or `.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/` for a triple-qualified build). The exact paths
  this skill's own verification used and confirmed working:
  - Test binary: `.build/debug/<Name>Tests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/<Name>Tests` (a macOS `.xctest` bundle; the
    symlink resolves this transparently, no need to chase it manually).
  - Coverage profile data: `.build/debug/codecov/default.profdata` (written by `swift test
    --enable-code-coverage`, again through the symlink).
  - `xcrun llvm-cov export -format=lcov <test-binary> -instr-profile <profdata>` **without** an
    `-ignore-filename-regex` includes SwiftPM's own synthesized `test_entry_point.swift` (under
    `.build/out/Intermediates.noindex/...`) and every file under `Tests/` in the LCOV output alongside the real
    `Sources/` coverage — confirmed by diffing the export with and without the flag. Pass
    `-ignore-filename-regex='\.build|Tests'` to get a `Sources/`-only report; `iru-swift-coverage` handles this
    itself when asked to report coverage, so a caller invoking that skill instead of raw `llvm-cov` doesn't need
    to remember this flag.
- **`swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources` auto-discovers `.swift-format` with no `--configuration`
  flag** — confirmed a stricter-than-default rule (`AllPublicDeclarationsHaveDocumentation: true`) in the
  committed `.swift-format` genuinely fired against an undocumented `public init()`, then passed clean once
  documented — the config file is not a no-op decoration.
- **`swift package generate-documentation --target <Name> --transform-for-static-hosting` writes to
  `.build/plugins/Swift-DocC/outputs/<Name>.doccarchive` by default, not to whatever directory
  `--allow-writing-to-directory` names** — confirmed: that flag only *grants permission* to write there if the
  plugin chooses to; without an explicit `--output-path <dir>`, the archive lands under `.build/plugins/` instead.
  Pass `--output-path <dir>` explicitly (in addition to `--allow-writing-to-directory <dir>`) whenever the
  generated documentation needs to land in a predictable location (e.g. a `docs/api/` directory a CI workflow
  later publishes) — confirmed `--output-path docs` places `index.html`, `documentation/`, `data/`, etc. directly
  under `docs/` as expected once added.
- **SwiftLint, the third-party `swiftformat` tool, `xcodegen`/`tuist`/`xcbeautify`/`periphery`, and `slather` are
  all unverified locally** — this environment has no `brew`, and installing any of them from source was out of
  scope for verifying this skill. `.swiftlint.yml` (Step 7) and `.swiftformat` (Step 7, only when `formatter:
  swiftformat`) are genericized from each tool's own documented config format but were never actually run against
  a real binary. `swift format` (the toolchain-bundled formatter) **is** verified, per the point above.
- Everything above was exercised end-to-end (`swift build`, `swift test --enable-code-coverage`, `xcrun llvm-cov
  export -format=lcov`, `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources`, `swift package
  generate-documentation --target <Name> --transform-for-static-hosting --output-path docs`) in
  `$TMPDIR/iru-verify/swift/library` against a package named `ExampleLibrary` (package name and `<Name>` made
  identical for that run, plus a second ad hoc check confirming the `package-name`-with-hyphens/`<Name>`-PascalCase
  split itself builds clean) with `platforms: ios, macos` (`.iOS(.v17)`, `.macOS(.v14)`) and `formatter:
  swift-format` — see that run's own files for the exact working `Package.swift`/`.swift-format`. `formatter:
  swiftformat`, `sonar-project.properties`'s coverage/swiftlint report paths, and `.spi.yml`'s actual submission
  to the Swift Package Index are **unverified locally** — each is called out individually above; re-verify before
  relying on them in a real repository.

## Step 14 — Report

Summarize what was generated: the resolved `package-name`/`<Name>`, the selected `platforms` with their
`min-deployment-targets`, the license chosen (or "none"), and the repository info inferred in Step 3.

State explicitly what was included versus omitted, and why:

- **`open-source`**: yes/no, as resolved in Step 2.
- **`publish`**: yes/no — if `yes`, `.spi.yml` was included; if `no`, it was omitted (note that this has no
  bearing on whether the package can still be used as a git-URL dependency — only on whether it's configured for
  submission to the Swift Package Index).
- **`sonar`**: `cloud`/`self-hosted`/`none` — if `cloud`/`self-hosted`, `sonar-project.properties` was included
  with the resolved `sonar.organization`/`sonar.projectKey`/`sonar.host.url`, and a reminder that
  `sonar.coverageReportPaths`/`sonar.swiftlint.reportPaths` both expect files a CI step still needs to produce; if
  `none`, note that this is expected when the project isn't open source unless the user explicitly chose it.
- **`formatter`**: `swift-format` (verified) or `swiftformat` (unverified locally) — which config file was
  written and whether it's confirmed working.

Then report which of Steps 5–9's files were created fresh, left untouched (fill-gaps/`mode: existing`), or
replaced (regenerate), and whether Step 13's two verification commands succeeded. If Step 1's existing files were
replaced, explicitly list what could have been lost — any target, dependency, or platform beyond what Steps 5–9's
templates show — and tell the user to check `git diff` for anything they need to re-add.

Finish with an explicit **Warn explicitly** block:

- **The user must review every generated file before building, committing, or publishing.** Confirm the license
  choice matches an actual `LICENSE` file (or that none is intended — suggest the `iru-check-license` skill to
  generate one and backfill source headers otherwise), that the inferred repository URL is correct, and that
  `swift build` succeeds before relying on this scaffold.
- If `sonar: cloud` or `sonar: self-hosted` was chosen, a `SONAR_TOKEN` (or equivalent) secret and an actual
  SonarCloud/SonarQube project matching `sonar.projectKey` still need to exist, and a CI step still needs to
  produce `sonarqube-generic-coverage.xml`/`swiftlint.json`, before a `sonar-scanner` run will succeed or report
  anything meaningful — this skill only writes `sonar-project.properties`, it does not run a scan itself.
- If `publish: yes` was chosen, `.spi.yml` alone doesn't submit the package to the Swift Package Index — that's a
  one-time manual step on swiftpackageindex.com the user still needs to do.
- No root `.gitignore` was written by this skill (`swift package init`'s own default was overwritten by Step 5's
  `Package.swift` rewrite but its `.gitignore` was left as `swift package init` generated it) — the
  `iru-setup-swift-gitignore` skill should be run next to confirm `.build`/`DerivedData`/`Package.resolved`
  (per Step 10's commit/ignore policy) are all handled correctly for this library.
- SwiftLint (`.swiftlint.yml`), the third-party SwiftFormat tool (`.swiftformat`, only if `formatter: swiftformat`
  was chosen), and `.spi.yml`'s actual Swift Package Index submission are **unverified locally** — spot-check
  whichever of them applies before trusting the generated scaffold to actually work end-to-end.
- The `swift-docc-plugin` version (Step 4) was resolved via a run-time lookup and may already be stale by the
  time this report is read — re-check before a first real release.
