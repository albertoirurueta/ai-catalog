Use whenever a repository needs a React + Vite + TypeScript web app bootstrapped with its full test/lint/e2e toolchain from this house template, instead of running `npm create vite` and wiring the rest by hand.

# Setup React Web

Scaffold a React + TypeScript web application with Vite, then layer on this catalog's standard
test/coverage/lint/format/e2e toolchain: Vitest (unit tests, `jsdom`, v8 coverage with lcov),
`@testing-library/react`, ESLint 10 flat config (or the Vite template's own Oxlint, kept by choice) with
`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, Prettier, Stylelint 17 for CSS, Playwright for a smoke end-to-end test, an
optional Storybook setup, and `sonar-project.properties` when Sonar is enabled. Every step below was proven
against the actual current tooling (Vite 8 / `create-vite` 9.2.1, ESLint 10, Vitest 5, Playwright 1.63,
Stylelint 17, Storybook 10) in a throwaway scaffold — the gotchas called out inline are real, observed
behavior, not speculation.

## Step 0 — Resolve inputs

This skill can be invoked stand-alone (`/iru-setup-react-web`) or driven by another orchestrating skill (e.g.
a future `iru-setup-repository` front door), which resolves these same inputs itself and passes them through
`args` as `key: value` lines, one per line, e.g.:

```
app-name: my-app
description: A React web application.
license: MIT License
developer-name: Jane Doe
developer-email: jane@example.com
organization-url: https://github.com/jane
open-source: yes
sonar: cloud
sonar-organization: example-github
sonar-project-key: example_my-app
sonar-host-url: https://sonarcloud.io
keep-oxlint: no
storybook: no
mode: new
```

Parse any such lines from `args` now. Every field found here is resolved — skip asking about it in Step 2.
Only fields genuinely missing from `args` still need a question. If `args` is absent or doesn't look like
this format, treat everything as unset and ask normally.

Recognized keys: `app-name`, `description`, `license`, `developer-name`, `developer-email`,
`organization-url`, `open-source` (`yes`/`no`), `sonar` (`cloud`/`self-hosted`/`none`, plus
`sonar-organization`/`sonar-project-key`/`sonar-host-url` only when `sonar` is `cloud` or `self-hosted`),
`keep-oxlint` (`yes` keeps the Vite template's Oxlint script alongside ESLint, `no` replaces it), `storybook`
(`yes`/`no`), and `mode` (`new`/`existing`). There is no `publish`/`distribution` key for this skill.

## Step 1 — Survey the repository

- If `mode` wasn't supplied via `args`, don't ask it as an isolated question — check whether `package.json`
  already exists at the repository root:
  - **No `package.json`**: default to `mode: new`, skip straight to Step 2.
  - **`package.json` already exists**: default to `mode: existing` and confirm with `AskUserQuestion`
    (`existing` pre-selected — gap-fill only what's missing; `new` as the other option, warning that it
    re-scaffolds from `npm create vite@latest` and can conflict with what's already there). If the user
    picks **stop**, report that `package.json` already exists and end here — make no changes.
- Also check whether the repository root is otherwise empty (ignoring dotfiles like `.git`, `.gitignore`, a
  `LICENSE`, or a `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`):
  - **Empty** (or `mode: existing`): scaffold `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` directly into
    the repository root (verified — `create-vite` accepts `.` as the target and infers the `package.json`
    `name` from the current directory's basename when no other name is given). Use the resolved `app-name`
    (Step 2) to override that inferred name afterward if it differs.
  - **Not empty, no `package.json` yet** (e.g. docs or CI files already present but no app scaffolded): ask
    the user with `AskUserQuestion` whether to scaffold into the repository root anyway (accepting that
    `create-vite` scaffolds alongside existing files — it does not require an empty directory, only warns if
    files would be overwritten) or into a subdirectory named after `app-name`.
- In `mode: existing`, additionally survey what's already wired so Steps 3–9 only fill gaps: does
  `vitest.config.ts`/`jest.config.*` exist (skip Step 4 if so), an ESLint/Oxlint config (skip Step 5's linter
  choice — use whichever exists), `.prettierrc`/`prettier` key (skip Prettier setup), a Stylelint config
  (skip Step 5's Stylelint block), `playwright.config.ts`/`e2e/` (skip Step 6), `.storybook/` (skip Step 7),
  `sonar-project.properties` (skip Step 8).

## Step 2 — Collect identity and options

For any field Step 0 already resolved from `args`, use that value directly. For everything else, ask the
user directly (plain conversation for free text; `AskUserQuestion` for the bounded choices below):

- **app-name** — only asked when scaffolding into a subdirectory (Step 1); when scaffolding into the
  repository root, default to the root directory's own basename and only ask if the user wants a different
  `package.json` name.
- **description** — one line, used in `package.json`.
- **Developer name**, **developer email**, **organizationUrl** — for `package.json`'s `author` field.

Then, unless Step 0 already resolved it, ask about the **license** with `AskUserQuestion` (same choices as
every other setup skill in this catalog, for consistency):

- Apache License 2.0 (recommended)
- MIT License
- No license (proprietary / all rights reserved)
- Other — ask for the license's display name directly afterward

If a license is chosen, remind the user in the final report to add a matching `LICENSE` file if one doesn't
exist yet — `iru-check-license` can verify/backfill source headers against it.

Then resolve `open-source` and `sonar` — skip either one Step 0 already resolved:

- **open-source** — is this repository open source? Yes / No.
- **sonar** — recommend **SonarCloud** (`cloud`) when open-source is Yes; when not open source, state that
  SonarCloud is free only for open-source projects (a paid plan is required otherwise) and recommend
  **None** (`none`), offering **self-hosted SonarQube** as the second option:
  - `cloud` — ask for `sonar.organization` (suggest `<owner>-github`, the owner parsed from
    `git remote get-url origin`), `sonar.projectKey` (suggest `<owner>_<repo>`), and confirm
    `sonar.host.url` defaults to `https://sonarcloud.io`.
  - `self-hosted` — ask for `sonar.host.url` directly, plus `sonar.organization` only if that server has
    organizations enabled, and `sonar.projectKey`.
  - `none` — Step 8 is skipped entirely; no `sonar-project.properties` is written.

Then, unless Step 0 already resolved `keep-oxlint`, ask **once** with `AskUserQuestion` (this is the one
question this skill is required to ask about the lint toolchain, per the current `create-vite` template
shipping Oxlint by default — verified: `npm create vite@latest <name> -- --template react-ts` today
generates `.oxlintrc.json` and a `"lint": "oxlint"` script, not ESLint):

- **Replace Oxlint with ESLint** (recommended — matches this catalog's ESLint-based `iru-typescript-*` gate
  skills, which understand ESLint rule ids, not Oxlint's) — Step 5 removes `.oxlintrc.json`, the `oxlint`
  devDependency, and the `oxlint` script, replacing them with the ESLint flat config below.
- **Keep Oxlint alongside ESLint** — Step 5 adds the ESLint flat config *in addition to* Oxlint, keeping both
  `"lint:oxlint": "oxlint"` and `"lint": "eslint . --max-warnings=0 && stylelint ..."` as separate scripts
  (`iru-typescript-code-quality` already expects this combination when both are configured).

Finally, ask **storybook** (`yes`/`no`, default **No** — it's a heavier, optional add-on) unless Step 0
already resolved it.

## Step 3 — Scaffold the Vite React app

Run (per Step 1's placement decision):

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```

or, scaffolding into a subdirectory:

```bash
npm create vite@latest <app-name> -- --template react-ts
```

Verified non-interactive as-is — no extra flags (`--yes`, `--no-interactive`) are needed or accepted by the
current `create-vite`; it scaffolds and exits cleanly without prompting as long as `--template react-ts` is
given. This generates (as of `create-vite@9.2.1`, Vite 8, React 19, TypeScript ~6.0):

- `package.json`, `index.html`, `src/` (`App.tsx`, `App.css`, `main.tsx`, `index.css`, `assets/`), `public/`
- `vite.config.ts` (`@vitejs/plugin-react`)
- `tsconfig.json` — **project references only**: `{"files": [], "references": [...]}`, pointing at
  `tsconfig.app.json` (`include: ["src"]`) and `tsconfig.node.json` (`include: ["vite.config.ts"]`). Neither
  referenced project's `noEmit`/strictness applies unless invoked through `tsc -b` (build mode) — see the
  critical gotcha in Step 9.
- `.oxlintrc.json` + `"lint": "oxlint"` in `package.json`'s scripts (this is the template's own linter —
  handled per the `keep-oxlint` choice in Step 5)
- A default `.gitignore` (`node_modules`, `dist`, `dist-ssr`, `*.local`, editor dirs) — leave as-is; nothing
  to add yet (Playwright's own init in Step 6 appends its entries; Storybook, if added in Step 7, appends its
  own `storybook-static` entry as part of its installer).

If `npm install` wasn't already triggered, run it now:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 4 — Add unit testing (Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom)

Look up current versions at run time (`npm view <package> version`); fall back to the versions verified
below if the registry is unreachable (observed 2026-09-16 — record whatever `npm view` returns as the
actual versions used in the report):

| Package | Fallback version |
|---|---|
| `vitest` | `5.0.1` |
| `@vitest/coverage-v8` | `5.0.1` |
| `@testing-library/react` | `16.3.3` |
| `@testing-library/jest-dom` | `7.0.1` |
| `jsdom` | `30.0.1` |

```bash
npm install -D vitest@<version> @vitest/coverage-v8@<version> @testing-library/react@<version> \
  @testing-library/jest-dom@<version> jsdom@<version>
```

Write `src/test/setup.ts`:

```ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'
```

Write `vitest.config.ts` at the repository root:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
    // Vitest's default `include` glob also matches Playwright's `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` files (Step 6), which
    // then fail when Vitest tries to run them (Playwright's `test()`/`test.describe()` API isn't Vitest's).
    // Verified: without this exclude, `npm run test`/`npm run coverage` fail with "You are calling test()
    // from an async test.describe() block. Only sync ones are supported." once e2e/ exists.
    exclude: ['e2e/**', 'node_modules/**', 'dist/**'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'lcov'],
      reportsDirectory: 'coverage',
      exclude: ['e2e/**', 'dist/**', '**/*.config.*', 'src/main.tsx'],
    },
  },
})
```

Replace the template's placeholder test with a real one — write `src/App.test.tsx` (adjust the matched text
to whatever the scaffolded `src/App.tsx` actually renders; the current template's heading is "Get started",
not the older "Vite + React"):

```tsx
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

describe('App', () => {
  it('renders the app shell', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/get started/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

Add to `package.json`'s `scripts`: `"test": "vitest run"`, `"coverage": "vitest run --coverage"`.

Verified: `npm run coverage` produces `coverage/lcov.info` plus an HTML report (`coverage/lcov-report/`) —
exclude `coverage/` from Prettier/Stylelint (Step 5) and from `.gitignore` if not already covered by `dist`.

## Step 5 — Add linting and formatting

### ESLint (or Oxlint — per the `keep-oxlint` choice from Step 2)

Look up current versions; fall back to those verified below:

| Package | Fallback version |
|---|---|
| `eslint` | `10.10.0` |
| `@eslint/js` | `10.0.1` |
| `typescript-eslint` | `8.70.0` |
| `eslint-config-prettier` | `10.1.8` |
| `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` | `7.1.1` |
| `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` | `0.5.7` |
| `globals` | `17.12.0` |

```bash
npm install -D eslint@<version> @eslint/js@<version> typescript-eslint@<version> \
  eslint-config-prettier@<version> eslint-plugin-react-hooks@<version> \
  eslint-plugin-react-refresh@<version> globals@<version>
```

Write `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import js from '@eslint/js'
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks'
import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh'
import eslintConfigPrettier from 'eslint-config-prettier'
import globals from 'globals'
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint'

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ['dist', 'coverage', 'e2e/**', 'playwright-report', 'storybook-static'] },
  {
    extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2023,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks,
      'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': ['warn', { allowConstantExport: true }],
    },
  },
  eslintConfigPrettier,
)
```

**If `keep-oxlint: no`** (replace): delete `.oxlintrc.json`, remove the `oxlint` devDependency
(`npm uninstall oxlint`), and set `package.json`'s `"lint"` script to
`"eslint . --max-warnings=0 && stylelint \"src/**/*.css\""` (Stylelint appended below).

**If `keep-oxlint: yes`** (keep alongside): leave `.oxlintrc.json` and the `oxlint` devDependency as-is, add
`"lint:oxlint": "oxlint"`, and set `"lint"` to
`"eslint . --max-warnings=0 && oxlint && stylelint \"src/**/*.css\""`.

Verified clean (`npx eslint .` exits 0) against the untouched scaffold from Step 3 once these rules are in
place — no template code needs changing to satisfy them.

### Prettier

Look up the current version (fallback `3.9.7`):

```bash
npm install -D prettier@<version>
```

Write `.prettierrc`:

```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100
}
```

Write `.prettierignore`:

```
coverage
dist
e2e/**
playwright-report
storybook-static
```

Add scripts: `"format": "prettier --check ."`, and run `npx prettier --write .` once now so the scaffolded
files (which are **not** pre-formatted to this config — the template ships with semicolons, this config
turns them off) pass `format` immediately instead of failing on the first CI run.

### Stylelint (CSS)

Look up current versions (fallback `stylelint@17.15.0`, `stylelint-config-standard@40.0.0`):

```bash
npm install -D stylelint@<version> stylelint-config-standard@<version>
```

Write `.stylelintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": ["stylelint-config-standard"],
  "ignoreFiles": ["dist/**", "coverage/**", "storybook-static/**"]
}
```

**Critical gotcha, verified**: `stylelint-config-standard` 40's modern-notation rules
(`color-function-notation`, `alpha-value-notation`, `media-feature-range-notation`,
`color-function-alias-notation`) flag the Vite template's own `src/App.css`/`src/index.css` out of the box
(53 errors observed on a completely untouched scaffold — old-style `rgba(0,0,0,.1)`, `@media (min-width:
...)`, etc.). Always run once right after writing the config, before reporting success:

```bash
npx stylelint "src/**/*.css" --fix
```

This autofixes every one of the observed violations with no manual changes needed. Re-run
`npx stylelint "src/**/*.css"` afterward to confirm zero remaining errors before moving on — if any remain
(a rule `--fix` can't auto-resolve), report them rather than silently leaving the lint script red for the
user's first run.

Finally, run `npx prettier --write .` again (Stylelint's `--fix` reformats the CSS files it touched, which
can disagree with Prettier's own formatting) and confirm `npm run format` passes.

## Step 6 — Add Playwright end-to-end tests

Look up the current version (fallback `1.63.0` for both `@playwright/test`/`playwright`):

```bash
npm init playwright@latest -- --quiet --lang ts --no-browsers
```

Verified non-interactive flags for the *current* `create-playwright` CLI (1.17.x) — **`--gha=false` is not
valid** (it errors `unknown option '--gha=false'`; `--gha` is a bare boolean flag, not `key=value` — omit it
entirely to skip generating a GitHub Actions workflow, since this catalog's own
`iru-setup-typescript-github-workflows` skill covers CI). `--lang ts` (not `TypeScript`) is accepted as-is.
`--no-browsers` skips downloading browser binaries here — Step 6's verification sub-task installs Chromium
separately, and so should a real run of this skill (see below).

This installs `@playwright/test`, writes `playwright.config.ts`, and scaffolds a `tests/` directory with a
placeholder test that hits `https://playwright.dev/` — none of which match this skill's target shape. Fix
both:

1. **Rename `tests/` to `e2e/`** and delete the placeholder `tests/example.spec.ts` (or its `e2e/` copy after
   the rename).
2. **Edit `playwright.config.ts`**:
   - `testDir: './e2e'` (was `'./tests'`).
   - Set `use.baseURL: 'http://localhost:4173'` (Vite's `preview` default port).
   - Add a `webServer` block so `npm run e2e` builds and serves the app itself rather than requiring a
     server already running:
     ```ts
     webServer: {
       command: 'npm run build && npm run preview',
       url: 'http://localhost:4173',
       reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
     },
     ```
   - Trim the `projects` array to Chromium only — the default template lists `chromium`, `firefox`, and
     `webkit`, but only Chromium is what gets installed below (and by this skill's own verification
     sub-task); leaving the other two in place makes `npm run e2e` report 2 failures out of the box with
     "Executable doesn't exist" until the user separately runs `npx playwright install firefox webkit`:
     ```ts
     /* Chromium only by default — this is what `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` provisions
        in CI. Add `firefox`/`webkit` projects (and install those browsers) if cross-browser coverage is
        needed. */
     projects: [
       {
         name: 'chromium',
         use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
       },
     ],
     ```

Write `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` — a real smoke test against the scaffolded app rather than an external site:

```ts
import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test'

test('home page renders the app shell', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/')
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /get started/i })).toBeVisible()
})
```

Add to `package.json`'s `scripts`: `"e2e": "playwright test"`.

Install the Chromium browser binary now so the smoke test can actually run:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Verified: on macOS this succeeds without sudo (`--with-deps` is effectively a no-op for system packages on
macOS). On Linux, `--with-deps` needs `sudo`/root to install OS packages via `apt`; if it fails for that
reason, fall back to `npx playwright install chromium` (browser binary only, no OS deps) and note in the
report that CI images (e.g. `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` or the official GitHub Actions runners, which
already have the OS deps) won't hit this at all.

Run `npm run e2e` and confirm the smoke test passes before reporting success.

Playwright's own installer appends `/test-results/`, `/playwright-report/`, `/blob-report/`,
`/playwright/.cache/`, `/playwright/.auth/` to `.gitignore` automatically — no extra `.gitignore` edit
needed here.

## Step 7 — Optional Storybook

Only run this step if `storybook: yes` was resolved in Step 2.

Look up the current version (fallback `10.6.0` for `storybook`/`@storybook/react-vite`):

```bash
npm create storybook@latest -- --yes --no-dev --type react --builder vite --disable-telemetry \
  --package-manager npm
```

Verified non-interactive: `--yes` answers every prompt, `--no-dev` skips launching the dev server after
install, `--disable-telemetry` avoids the telemetry prompt. This installs `storybook` plus a cluster of
addons (`@storybook/addon-a11y`, `@storybook/addon-docs`, `@storybook/addon-vitest`, `@chromatic-com/storybook`,
`@storybook/addon-mcp`), scaffolds `.storybook/` (`main.ts`, `preview.tsx`), and adds `"storybook": "storybook
dev -p 6006"` / `"build-storybook": "storybook build"` scripts.

**Important, verified interaction**: `@storybook/addon-vitest`'s installer *rewrites* `vitest.config.ts` from
Step 4 into a multi-`projects` config — it keeps the existing `jsdom` unit-test setup as one project
(`extends: true`) and adds a second `storybook` project that runs stories as browser-mode tests via
`@vitest/browser-playwright` (which needs its own Playwright browser install, separate from Step 6's
`e2e/`). This means:

- `npm run test`/`npm run coverage` (still `vitest run [--coverage]` with no `--project` filter) now execute
  **both** projects — the unit project plus the browser-mode Storybook project — which is slower and needs
  Playwright browsers installed for Storybook's own use, not just Step 6's `e2e/` smoke test.
- If that combined run isn't wanted (e.g. the unit-only `coverage` gate should stay fast and
  browser-install-free), scope the scripts explicitly instead: `"test": "vitest run --project=unit"`,
  `"coverage": "vitest run --project=unit --coverage"`, and add a separate `"test:storybook": "vitest run
  --project=storybook"` script the user can opt into.
- Re-run `npm run format`/`npm run lint` after this step — the addon-vitest installer's rewritten
  `vitest.config.ts` is not Prettier-formatted to this project's `.prettierrc`.

Because this step substantially reshapes the test config, treat it as genuinely optional (default **No** in
Step 2) and call out in the report exactly what it changed, including whichever of the two script-scoping
options above was applied.

## Step 8 — `sonar-project.properties`

Only run this step if `sonar` resolved to `cloud` or `self-hosted` in Step 2. Write
`sonar-project.properties` at the repository root:

```properties
sonar.organization=<sonar-organization>
sonar.projectKey=<sonar-project-key>
sonar.host.url=<sonar-host-url>
sonar.sources=src
sonar.tests=src
sonar.test.inclusions=**/*.test.tsx,**/*.test.ts
sonar.exclusions=**/e2e/**,**/dist/**
sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info
```

**Placeholder resolution:**

| Placeholder | Resolved from |
|---|---|
| `<sonar-organization>` | Step 2's `sonar-organization` answer (omit the whole line if `sonar: self-hosted` and the server has no organizations enabled) |
| `<sonar-project-key>` | Step 2's `sonar-project-key` answer |
| `<sonar-host-url>` | Step 2's `sonar-host-url` answer (`https://sonarcloud.io` for `cloud`) |

`sonar.tests=src` (not a separate `test/` directory) because tests are colocated with source
(`src/App.test.tsx` next to `src/App.tsx`) — `sonar.test.inclusions` is what actually tells Sonar which of
the files under `sonar.sources` are tests rather than production code. `sonar.exclusions` keeps `e2e/` (a
different test type, reported separately if at all) and the build output out of the main scan.

If `sonar: none`, skip this step entirely and note in the report that Sonar was deliberately not wired up.

## Step 9 — Wire up npm scripts and final `tsconfig` fix

By this point `package.json`'s `scripts` should read (module-manager-agnostic — every command below is
`npm run <script>`):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "lint": "eslint . --max-warnings=0 && stylelint \"src/**/*.css\"",
    "format": "prettier --check .",
    "typecheck": "tsc -b",
    "e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

(Adjust `lint` per the `keep-oxlint` choice from Step 5, and `test`/`coverage` per Storybook's project-scoping
note in Step 7 if Storybook was added.)

**Critical gotcha, verified — do this unconditionally**: the scaffolded root `tsconfig.json` is
project-references-only (`{"files": [], "references": [...]}`). Running `tsc --noEmit` directly at the root
**silently exits 0 without checking anything** — `files: []` means there is nothing in the root project
itself to check, and plain `tsc` does not follow `references` the way `tsc -b` (build mode) does. Verified by
injecting a real type error into `src/App.tsx`: `npx tsc --noEmit` at the root reported nothing and exited 0,
while `npx tsc -b` correctly caught it. **Always use `"typecheck": "tsc -b"`, never `"typecheck": "tsc
--noEmit"`, for this template's `tsconfig.json` shape.**

A second, related gotcha: neither `tsconfig.app.json` (`include: ["src"]`) nor `tsconfig.node.json`
(`include: ["vite.config.ts"]`) covers `e2e/` or `playwright.config.ts` from Step 6 — `tsc -b` silently skips
type-checking them too. Add a third referenced project. Write `tsconfig.e2e.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "./node_modules/.tmp/tsconfig.e2e.tsbuildinfo",
    "target": "es2023",
    "lib": ["ES2023"],
    "types": ["node"],
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "module": "nodenext",
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "noEmit": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  },
  "include": ["e2e", "playwright.config.ts"]
}
```

And add it as a third reference in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    { "path": "./tsconfig.app.json" },
    { "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" },
    { "path": "./tsconfig.e2e.json" }
  ]
}
```

Verified: without this third project, injecting the same kind of type error into `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` was
*not* caught by `tsc -b`, `npm run build`, or `npm run e2e` (Playwright's own TS transform strips types
without checking them) — the error would only ever surface in an editor. With `tsconfig.e2e.json` referenced,
`tsc -b` catches it as expected.

Run the full sequence once, in order, before reporting success — this is exactly what Step 9.2 of this
skill's own verification exercised:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format && npm run test && npm run coverage \
  && npm run build && npm run e2e
```

## Step 10 — Report

Summarize what was generated: the app name and location (repository root or subdirectory), the license
chosen (or "none"), and whether this ran in `mode: new` or `mode: existing` (and, if `existing`, which pieces
were already present and left untouched vs. which were added).

State explicitly what was included versus omitted, and why:

- **`open-source`**: yes/no, as resolved in Step 2.
- **Linter**: ESLint only (Oxlint removed) or ESLint + Oxlint kept alongside, per the `keep-oxlint` choice —
  name which `package.json` scripts run which tool.
- **`sonar`**: `cloud`/`self-hosted`/`none` — if `cloud`/`self-hosted`, `sonar-project.properties` was
  written with the resolved organization/project key/host URL; if `none`, note that this is expected when
  the project isn't open source (SonarCloud is free only for open-source projects) unless the user explicitly
  chose it.
- **`storybook`**: yes/no — if yes, call out the `vitest.config.ts` project-split from Step 7 and which
  script-scoping option (combined vs. `--project=unit`/`--project=storybook`) was applied.

Then report each verification command actually run and its result (typecheck, lint, format, unit test,
coverage — including the `coverage/lcov.info` path — build, e2e), and explicitly flag the two `tsconfig`
gotchas from Step 9 (`tsc -b` vs. `tsc --noEmit`; the `tsconfig.e2e.json` third project) as something to
preserve if the user or another tool later "simplifies" the TypeScript config.

Finish with an explicit **Warn explicitly** block:

- **Review every generated file before committing** — `package.json`'s `author`/`description`, the license
  text, and the Sonar organization/project key (if set) should all be double-checked.
- **`sonar: cloud`/`self-hosted`** was chosen: a `SONAR_TOKEN` repository secret and an actual
  SonarCloud/SonarQube project matching `sonar.projectKey` still need to exist before a CI-run Sonar scan
  (typically via `iru-setup-typescript-github-workflows`) will succeed.
- **Playwright's browser binaries** were installed locally for verification (`npx playwright install
  --with-deps chromium`) — CI will need the same step (or a Playwright-provided Docker image) before `npm run
  e2e` can run there; on Linux runners without root, use `npx playwright install chromium` (binary only) if
  `--with-deps` fails.
- If a license was chosen and no `LICENSE` file exists yet, suggest `iru-check-license` to generate one and
  backfill source headers.
- If Storybook was added, remind the user that `npm run storybook` starts a dev server on port 6006 and
  `npm run build-storybook` produces `storybook-static/` — neither is wired into this skill's own `build`
  script, by design, so a separate CI step is needed if the Storybook site should be published.
