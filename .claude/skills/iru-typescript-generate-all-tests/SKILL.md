# TypeScript Generate All Tests

Bring an entire TypeScript codebase's unit test coverage up to a minimum bar (80% line coverage) in one pass:
find every source file with no test at all or with measured coverage below the bar, then write or extend tests
for each until it clears it. This skill is TypeScript/npm only — it never runs against, or falls back to, any
other language. It only adds/extends test code; it does not add license headers, TSDoc, or run a lint/code-quality
pass (those are separate skills' jobs), and it only touches production source code if a file is genuinely
untestable as written (see Step 5) — which it reports rather than silently "fixing" by redesigning the module.

## Step 1 — Confirm this is a TypeScript/npm project

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -name package.json -not -path "*/node_modules/*"
```

- **None found**: this skill applies only to TypeScript/npm projects. Tell the user plainly and stop — do not
  attempt any other language's equivalent or partial exploration.
- **Found but no TypeScript toolchain** (no `typescript` dependency, no `tsconfig.json`): tell the user this
  skill is for TypeScript projects specifically and stop.
- **Found**: continue. If there are multiple `package.json` files (a monorepo/workspaces setup) and no obvious
  single target, ask (`AskUserQuestion`) which workspace to scope this run to rather than guessing.

Detect the project's **flavor** the same way as the rest of this plan's TypeScript skills — inspect
`package.json`: `@vaadin/hilla`/`hilla-spring-boot-starter` in `pom.xml` or a `src/main/frontend/` dir →
`hilla-frontend`; `expo` or `react-native` → `react-native`; `@ionic/angular` or `@ionic/react` +
`@capacitor/core` → `ionic`; `@angular/core` → `angular`; `react` + `vite` → `react`; otherwise `library`. This
drives which testing library Step 5 uses. Also detect the **test runner** (`vitest` in devDependencies →
Vitest; `jest`/`jest-expo` → Jest; `@angular/build` with the `unit-test` builder → `ng test`, Vitest runner
underneath) and the **package manager** (`packageManager` field or lockfile: `package-lock.json` → npm,
`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn) — both needed later to invoke `iru-typescript-coverage`/
`iru-typescript-test` consistently, though those skills re-detect them independently too.

## Step 2 — Discover every candidate file and the existing test convention

Use the `Explore` agent for this — a repository of any real size has too many source files to read directly one
by one, and this step needs a structural map, not a design review.

- Identify every **main-source** file under the project's source root (typically `src/`, or
  `src/main/frontend/` for Hilla) with a `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` extension, excluding:
  - `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `coverage/`, and any other build output.
  - Type-declaration files (`*.d.ts`).
  - Barrel files that only re-export (`index.ts`/`index.tsx` containing solely `export * from`/`export {...}
    from` statements — read the file to confirm before excluding; an `index.ts` with real logic is a candidate).
  - Config files at any level (`vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig*.json`,
    `tailwind.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`, `capacitor.config.ts`, `angular.json`,
    `typedoc.json`, etc.).
  - Bootstrap/entry files with no branching logic of their own (`main.ts`, `main.tsx`, `index.html`'s script
    entry, Angular's `main.ts`/`bootstrapApplication` call, Expo's `App.tsx` when it only mounts a navigator).
  - Generated directories, notably `src/main/frontend/generated/` (Hilla's generated endpoint clients — never
    hand-written, never tested directly) and any other `*/generated/` tree.
  - Storybook files (`*.stories.ts`/`*.stories.tsx`).
  - End-to-end specs (`e2e/**`, `*.e2e.ts`, Playwright/Maestro/Cypress specs) and existing unit test files
    themselves (`*.test.ts(x)`, `*.spec.ts(x)`, `test/**`, `__tests__/**`).
  - Pure type-only modules (files that export only `interface`/`type` declarations with no runtime code) and
    pure constant/config data modules with no logic. Use judgment the same way as the Java skill: note these as
    "excluded, no testable logic" in the final report rather than silently dropping them or forcing trivial
    tests onto them.
- Identify the **existing test-file convention** actually in use — do not assume one, detect it from what's on
  disk:
  - **Sibling co-located**: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`/`foo.test.tsx` in the same directory (common for
    library/React/React Native projects using Vitest or Jest).
  - **Sibling `.spec` suffix**: `foo.ts` → `foo.spec.ts` in the same directory (Angular's own convention,
    typically generated by `ng generate`).
  - **Mirrored `test/` directory**: a separate `test/` tree whose structure mirrors `src/` (common for
    library-flavor npm packages, e.g. `src/utils/format.ts` → `test/utils/format.test.ts`).
  - If more than one convention is present, follow whichever the majority of existing tests use; if genuinely
    mixed with no majority, ask (`AskUserQuestion`).
  - If **no test files exist at all** and no test runner is configured (`vitest`/`jest`/`@angular/build`
    unit-test builder absent from `package.json`), stop and tell the user: this skill extends an existing test
    setup's coverage, it doesn't scaffold one from nothing — ask (`AskUserQuestion`) whether tests actually live
    somewhere unconventional before concluding there really are none.
- For every candidate file, resolve whether a matching test file already exists by that convention, and its
  path if so.

Build a plain list: source file path → matching test file path (or "none").

## Step 3 — Measure real coverage for every candidate file in one pass

Delegate this to `iru-typescript-coverage` via the `iru-gate-runner` agent, so a large `lcov.info`/coverage HTML
report never lands directly in this conversation's context, and so the whole suite is only executed once
regardless of how many files are in scope:

```
Agent({
  description: "Measure coverage for every candidate file",
  subagent_type: "iru-gate-runner",
  prompt: "Invoke Skill({skill: \"iru-typescript-coverage\", args: \"<file1,file2,...>\"}) with no test
    selector, so the whole suite runs once and every file is measured in the same pass. Report back, per target
    file: its exact line coverage percentage; and, ONLY for files below 80%, the specific uncovered line
    ranges too (from coverage-summary.json / lcov.info). For files at or above 80%, report just the percentage —
    do not include per-line detail for those, to keep the report compact.",
  run_in_background: false
})
```

If the candidate list from Step 2 is very large (rough guide: more than ~50 files), split it into a few batches
of target-file arguments passed in the same `iru-typescript-coverage` call structure above so no single
`iru-gate-runner` report becomes unwieldy — this still only requires one full-suite run per batch, not one per
file.

If a file has no matching test file (Step 2) it will simply show 0% (or be entirely absent from the coverage
summary) — treat "absent from the report" the same as "0%, no coverage," per `iru-typescript-coverage`'s own
reporting convention.

## Step 4 — Classify

From Step 3's results, split every candidate file into:

- **Missing tests**: no matching test file (Step 2), regardless of reported percentage.
- **Below bar**: a matching test file exists, but line coverage is under 80%.
- **Already sufficient**: line coverage is 80% or above — skip these entirely, count them for the final report.

## Step 5 — Generate or extend tests, one file at a time

For every file in the "missing tests" or "below bar" buckets, write (or extend) its unit tests. Since each
file's test is independent of every other's, dispatch one sub-agent per file **concurrently** (in batches of a
manageable size — a handful at a time rather than dozens at once — if the bucket is large):

```
Agent({
  description: "Write/extend tests for <fileName>",
  prompt: "Read <source-file-path> in full — this is the module to cover. <If a test file already exists at
    <test-file-path>: read it too; these lines are currently uncovered: <line ranges from Step 3> — extend this
    file with tests that exercise them.> <If no test file exists: create one at <path implied by this project's
    naming/directory convention from Step 2>.> Use the project's detected flavor's testing library: plain
    TypeScript/Node logic → Vitest or Jest (whichever this repository already uses) with `vi.fn`/`jest.fn` for
    mocks and `vi.mock`/`jest.mock` for module mocking; React components → `@testing-library/react` +
    `@testing-library/user-event`, jsdom environment, query by role/label/text (not test-id first); React
    Native components → `@testing-library/react-native` under the `jest-expo` preset; Angular
    components/services → `TestBed`, `HttpTestingController` + `provideHttpClientTesting` for anything calling
    `HttpClient`, run through `ng test --include=<path>` for this file alone; Ionic components → the same
    library as the underlying framework (Angular TestBed or React Testing Library, per Step 1's `framework`
    detection); Hilla frontend views/components → Vitest in browser mode per Vaadin's own Vitest browser-mode
    config, never hand-testing the generated endpoint clients under `generated/` (treat them as a trusted
    external dependency to mock, not code to cover). Match this project's existing test style exactly:
    describe/it vs. test(), same assertion library already in use. Cover the file's actual behavior, including
    edge cases (invalid-prop/invalid-argument handling implied by its own validation logic, boundary conditions,
    conditional branches, error paths) — not superficial calls that merely execute lines without asserting real
    behavior. Never write a snapshot-only test (a bare `toMatchSnapshot()` with no other assertions) — snapshots
    may supplement real assertions but must not be the only coverage a test provides. Do not modify the module
    under test unless it is genuinely untestable as written (e.g. a hard dependency on a non-injectable
    singleton or global with no seam to substitute it) — if so, make the minimal change needed to add a seam
    (e.g. accepting a dependency as a parameter, extracting a hook/service) and say so explicitly rather than
    reporting it as a plain test addition. Report back: the test file touched (new or extended), what was
    added, and whether the module under test needed a minimal testability change.",
  run_in_background: false
})
```

Collect every sub-agent's report before moving on.

## Step 6 — Re-measure and iterate on shortfalls

Re-run Step 3's delegated `iru-typescript-coverage` pass, scoped to just the files touched in Step 5, to confirm
each now meets 80%. For any file still below the bar:

- Identify the specific lines still uncovered (already returned by this re-measurement).
- Dispatch one more Step 5-style agent for just that file, focused on the remaining uncovered lines.
- Re-measure once more.

Cap this at two extension attempts per file. A file still below 80% after that is a genuine residual gap —
report it as such (Step 8), with the exact lines still uncovered, rather than looping indefinitely. Common
legitimate reasons: defensive code paths that are difficult or unsafe to trigger from a unit test (a caught
"impossible" error, a platform-specific branch that only runs on a device this environment can't emulate), or
framework glue code (e.g. an Angular `NgModule`-free bootstrap file, a Hilla generated-client wrapper) that
carries no real logic to assert against. Name these explicitly if that's what remains uncovered.

## Step 7 — Run the full suite once to confirm no regressions

Delegate to `iru-gate-runner`: `Agent({description: "Run full test suite", subagent_type: "iru-gate-runner", prompt:
"Invoke Skill({skill: \"iru-typescript-test\"}) (fall back to `npm test`/`vitest run`/`jest`/`ng test
--watch=false` directly if unavailable). If everything passed, report back only that all tests passed. If
anything failed, report back only the failing test names, the failure reason, and the stack trace for each."})`.
Fix any regression this run's new/extended tests introduced (a genuine bug in a generated test, not a
pre-existing failure), then re-invoke until it reports all tests passed. A pre-existing failure unrelated to any
file this run touched is out of scope — note it in Step 8 rather than fixing it.

## Step 8 — Report

Summarize:

- Total candidate files found (Step 2), and how many were excluded as having no testable logic, with names.
- The detected flavor, test runner, package manager, and test-file convention this run followed.
- How many were already at or above 80% and left untouched.
- For each file in the "missing tests"/"below bar" buckets: before/after line coverage, and whether its test
  file was newly created or extended.
- Any file that required a minimal testability change to the module under test (Step 5), named explicitly.
- Any file still below 80% after Step 6's two attempts, with the exact lines still uncovered and, where
  apparent, why (e.g. an untestable defensive branch or generated-code wrapper).
- The full-suite result from Step 7.

Do not run a code-quality, license-header, or TSDoc pass — those are `iru-typescript-code-quality`,
`iru-check-license`, and `iru-typescript-tsdoc`'s jobs respectively, not this skill's.
